# PEG Scanner

This project is a stock analysis tool for quantitative stock selection, focusing on US stocks. It is being developed using an "AI-native" approach, where an AI agent (like me) actively participates in the development process.

The core requirements and instructions for the agent are defined in [agent.md](./agent.md).

## Installation

To set up the Nx monorepo workspace, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
npx nx init peg-scanner --prefer-free-syntax
```

This command will initialize the Nx workspace directly within the current directory, naming it `peg-scanner`. Follow any prompts to configure the workspace. It's recommended to choose an "integrated" monorepo style for mixed technologies (React Native and Python).
