# PEG Scanner

This project is a stock analysis tool for quantitative stock selection, focusing on US stocks. It is being developed using an "AI-native" approach, where an AI agent (like me) actively participates in the development process.

The core requirements and instructions for the agent are defined in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

## Installation

To set up the Nx monorepo workspace, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
npx nx init peg-scanner --prefer-free-syntax
```

This command will initialize the Nx workspace directly within the current directory, naming it `peg-scanner`. Follow any prompts to configure the workspace. It's recommended to choose an "integrated" monorepo style for mixed technologies (React Native and Python).

## Development Workflow

1. Run `npm run lint:structure` to ensure the workspace layout remains compliant.
2. Start hot-reload services with `npm run dev` (spawns `npx nx run backend:start` + `npx nx run mobile:start` via `concurrently`; respect `MOBILE_DEV_PORT` env var). This command also clears `apps/mobile/node_modules/.vite` first, eliminating the “Outdated Optimize Dep” 504 errors. Use `Ctrl+C` when finished. For the web preview, run `npx nx run mobile:serve` (Vite on port `MOBILE_WEB_PORT`, default 5173) and open `http://localhost:5173`.
3. Run automated checks while servers are running:
   - Backend proto tests: `npx nx run backend:test`
   - Regression ping: `npx nx run regression:ping` (backend server must be running)
   - Infra E2E (backend + web reachability): `npx nx run regression:infra-flow`
   - Full web E2E (backend + Vite + Playwright): `npx nx run regression:web-e2e`
   - Mobile typecheck: `npx nx run mobile:typecheck`
4. For manual control or headless environments, use `./tools/dev.sh start|stop [backend|mobile …]`; logs/PIDs live under `x-log/`.
