# Iteration Flow – Phase 1 (Single Stock Page)

1. **Morning Sync (or first session)**
   - Re-read `AGENTS.md`, `../../../specs/infra/IRD-001.md`, `../todowrite.md`, and this iteration's checklist.
   - Append any new prompts to `../prompt.md` and mirror them here if they affect Phase 1.
   - Reprioritize backlog items in `plan.md` if new constraints arrive.

2. **Work Block Execution**
   - Pick the highest priority task from `plan.md`.
   - Before editing, inspect existing docs/code to reuse material (SSOT rule).
   - Implement the change, run required tests/data checks, and capture evidence.

3. **Documentation Sweep**
   - Update the touched directory's README and bubble the summary up to the root README.
   - Record progress in `../README.md` and, if relevant, `docs/index.md`.
   - Update `checklist.md` items and note blockers or follow-ups.

4. **Close-out / Handoff**
   - Confirm `../todowrite.md` reflects any unmet requirements discovered.
   - Summarize the session outcome (completed items, pending items) so the next agent can resume without context loss.
